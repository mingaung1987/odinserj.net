title: Hangfire 1.0 Released
---

[Hangfire](http://hangfire.io) has finally reached the `1.0` milestone! This means that public API is frozen and considered to be stable. Starting from now, the [SemVer 2.0](http://semver.org) specification will be used for versioning every package (but there may be exceptions, follow the README for each package).

I want to thank everyone who helped me to reach this milestone, without your participation I would not be able to finish the work. Special thanks:

* [@devmondo](https://github.com/devmondo) – for endless optimism that helped me a lot in difficult times.
* [@dennyferra](https://github.com/dennyferra) – for awesome [Hangfire.RabbitMQ](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hangfire.SqlServer.RabbitMQ/) extension.

### Release Notes

* **Added** – OWIN implementation for Hangfire Dashboard.
* **Added** – Custom authorization filters support for dashboard.
* **Added** – Unified bootstrapper to start Hangfire in web applications.
* **Added** – Descriptive names for background jobs in Dashboard.
* **Added** – RabbitMQ support for SQL Server storage.
* **Changed** – Hangfire now requires .NET Framework 4.5.
* **Changed** – Namespaces, assemblies and packages now start with `Hangfire` (not `HangFire`).
* **Changed** – `Hangfire.Core` now contains the dashboard. There is no more `Hangfire.Web`.
* **Changed** – Common.Logging dependency package updated to 2.2.0.
* **Changed** – Default dashboard url is now '/hangfire' (without `.axd` suffix).
* **Removed** – Removed `Enqueue` method overloads with queue parameter.
* **Removed** – Removed `AspNetBackgroundJobServer` class.
* **Fixed** – Russian language in Dashboard replaced with English.
* **Fixed** – Recurring jobs reported to be executed 44 years ago.

### Upgrading from 0.x

If you have only `Hangfire` package installed, package update is very simple. Just type in your Package Manager Console window:

```
PM> Update-Package Hangfire
```

For custom installations, first update each package, and then remove the `Hangfire.Web`:

```
PM> Update-Package Hangfire.Core
PM> Uninstall-Package Hangfire.Web
```

### Breaking Changes

* [Target your project](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb398202.aspx) to .NET Framework 4.5 or later.
* Replace all occurrences of `HangFire` (case-sensitive) to `Hangfire` (lowercased `f` letter) in your projects.
* Use the [`UseHangfire`](http://docs.hangfire.io/en/latest/users-guide/getting-started/owin-bootstrapper.html) extension method for OWIN app builder instead of `AspNetBackgroundJobServer`.
